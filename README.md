# HangMan_Game
I've been working on a fun and challenging project that has significantly enhanced my JavaScript skills: a web-based Hangman game! It is a web-based implementation of the classic Hangman game, where users guess letters to form a word before running out of attempts. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Features
- Random word generation for each game
- Letter input through mouse clicks and keyboard
- Visual representation of the hangman
- Tracks remaining attempts and guessed letters
- Hint given for each word
- Responsive design for various devices

# Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structures the game, including the placeholders for the word, letters, and hangman graphic.
- **CSS:** Styles the game to ensure it is visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the game logic, including random word selection, letter input handling, updating the display, and tracking game state.
